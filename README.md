# Read Magic Card
A computer vision project for identifying *Magic: the Gathering*-cards.

## I just want to run the code!
Go to the page for releases and read the instructions for the latest release.
https://github.com/klanderfri/ReadMagicCard/releases

## Where do I get the result data?
The program will present the results in two ways.
 1. In the command line window.
 2. In a tab separated file named *CardTitles.txt* in the subfolder *Image Data*.

## What else to know?
Not much. This program should be quite straightforward.

Developers and curious users might want to head for the CONTRIBUTING.md file though.
